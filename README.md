### Hi, I'm Rebecka 👋

Junior Software Engineer graduating in June 2026 in Software Engineering & Management.

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems, and building systems that combine software, AI and real-world integration.

Current focus:
- Web development (Vue, Node, Django)
- AI & automation (exploring ML pipelines)
- IoT & system integration (MQTT, Arduino)
- Docker & Kubernetes

Projects you’ll find here:
- HarmonAI – AI-based chord analysis from audio
- Peekaboo – Smart mirror (IoT)
- Webmall – Platform for creative sellers

Always curious, adaptable, and happy to dive into new challenges.
